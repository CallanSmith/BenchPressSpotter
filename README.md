# BenchPressSpotter

## Description

Our goal for this project is to create a bench press spotting machine that allows someone to re rack a failed rep by assisting with 20+ lbs of load. The problem we are trying to solve is the danger of not having a spotter when going for a 1 rep max.

## Criteria

## Constraints

## Solutions
Solution #1: Two simple articulated arms that would pick up bar and rerack it. The advantages of this desgin are that it would be simple to make the arms able to move the bar in a way that it could rerack it, however, two arms could not handle the load of the bar and that is why we didn't do this idea.
